Features
It is significant to verify that the IP PBX that someone select provides the features that he needs, but then don't get too worried on choosing the product with the most features. It has been my understanding that as a company's opponents provide more features, then a company will soon offer those similar features to their clients through a firmware update. 

Support
When your IP PBX is up and working, you perhaps won't require a lot of support, but then again a PBX system is such a critical component of a company's infrastructure that have to verify that top-notch support is available every time client require it. Therefore, it makes sense to confirm that the company's support line is offered 24 hours a day. 

Client should also check that the persons working the support line are well-organized and reasonable. If you are calling a technical support line, it means that you have an issue that you have to resolve quickly. If somebody working the tech support line is unclear to you, then it will take much longer to get the issue fixed. 

Whereas we are on the subject of support, make sure to check into the fee of the support. Few providers charge a fee for all support features; however others provide annual support contracts.
